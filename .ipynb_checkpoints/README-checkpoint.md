# What our program does:

Our python code takes the inputs of the user's name and the day of the week(as a number) and tells the user how far away the weekend is. If it's already the weekend it will tell the user it is already the weekend.

# How to use it

When asked the user should input their name and the current day of the week (a number 1-7).
